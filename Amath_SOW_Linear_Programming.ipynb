The carpenter can afford to spend up to 40 hours per week working and takes six hours to make a table and three hours to make a chair. Customer demand requires that he makes at least three times as many chairs as tables. Tables take up four times as much storage space as chairs and there is room for at most four tables each week. "

The clinic needs to decide how many of each format to produce for sale. Estimates show that no more than 10 000 copies of both items together will be sold. At least 4 000 copies of the video and at least 2 000 copies of the book could be sold, although sales of the book are not expected to exceed 4 000 copies. Let x be the number of videos sold, and y the number of printed books sold. Each video will sell for £50 and each book for £30. Write down the objective function and contraints and solve for What maximum income will be generated by the two guides?"
